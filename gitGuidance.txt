1. git init - initialize git, Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/marvolo/Documents/Lucid/Supplier Portal/Web Development/Story/.git/ (locally/working directory)

You need to check this using $ls -a

In order to start tracking the changes of my files, for example chapter1.txt, then I need to add this file to what's called a staging area. And that is basically a intermediate place where you can pick and choose which files inside your working directory that you want to commit.

2. git status - to see what's currently inside your staging area, if the file name is red, that means they're only in the current working directory but not in the staging area.

3. git add chapter1.txt (file name) - add it to the staging area and to start tracking changes in it 

git add . - everything inside the current directory 

4. git commit -m "XXXX" - this is now in the staging area and it's ready to be committed

5. git log - what commits you have made
